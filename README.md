golang Problem-Solving Repository
Welcome to my golang Problem-Solving repository! ðŸŽ‰ Here, I am solving various coding challenges and problems in Go (Golang) as I improve my skills and understanding of this powerful programming language.

About the Repository
This repository contains solutions to a variety of coding problems from different domains such as:

Algorithms
Data Structures
Mathematics
Strings
Sorting and Searching
And more!
Each problem is implemented in Go, following best practices and clean coding principles.

Each problem's solution is placed in the problem-solving-golang/problem-directory.
Folders are named according to the problem they solve.
The README.md serves as an introduction to the project.
Inside each problem folder PROBLEM-DETAILS.md this is the problem details and necessary link for the details. 
How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/runtimeninja/problem-solving-golang.git
cd problem-solving-golang
Navigate to the specific problem file you'd like to review.

Run the solution:

bash
Copy code
go run problem-folder/main.go
Modify or improve the solutions to fit your style!

Goals and Motivation
Strengthen my understanding of Go.
Solve algorithmic challenges to prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming.
Document my progress and learning journey.
